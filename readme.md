## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Structure

The assignment is divided into two main parts:

1. **SQL Task**

   - Focuses on feature engineering using SQL.
   - Detailed instructions can be found in the `sql_task` folder.

2. **Python Task**
   - Involves implementing business logic for a new scorecard.
   - Detailed instructions can be found in the `python_task` folder.

---

## ðŸš€ Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the **SQL Task** to calculate the required features.
2. Move on to the **Python Task** to implement the decision-making logic.

Each task folder contains its own detailed instructions and examples to guide you through the process.
